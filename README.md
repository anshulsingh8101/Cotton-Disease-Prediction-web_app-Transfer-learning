# Cotton-Disease-Prediction
Used 2 models for predicting whether, if the cotton plant has a disease or not, using the inceptionv3 model and the ResNet50 model.

We see that the inceptionv3 is better in terms of validation accuracy eventhough it has 2 million less params then the ResNet50 application of transfer learning.

A web app has been also created for deploying the model on.
